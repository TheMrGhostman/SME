NAME: Pizza size data

TYPE: Designed experiment 

SIZE: 250 observations, 4 variables (plus an identifier) 



DESCRIPTIVE ABSTRACT:
The data give the diameters of 250 pizzas, 125 each from two pizza chains, for a variety of crust types and toppings.  
The data are used by a pizza chain to make claims about the size of their pizzas relative to those of another pizza chain.



VARIABLE DESCRIPTIONS:
A header line contains the names of the variables.  Each case has one line in the data file.  The data are comma delimited.  
There are no missing values (though pizzas with ID 192 and 192 do not appear in the data file at all).


ID:  An identifier


Store:  The pizza store/company; one of Dominos or EagleBoys


CrustDescription:  The crust type for the pizza; one of DeepPan, ClassicCrust (Domino's only), MidCrust (Domino's only), 
ThinNCrispy (Eagle Boys only) or ThinCrust (Eagle Boys only)


Topping: The pizza topping; one of Hawaiian, BBQMeatlovers, Supreme (Domino's only) or SuperSupremo (Eagle Boys only).


Diameter:  The pizza diameter, in centimetres


SPECIAL NOTES:
The data have been intentionally provided needing some alterations, because this is how the data are made available from the source.  
We recommend the following.


* The variable CrustDescription uses the terms used by the two pizza companies, which are not the same.  Relabel the CrustDescription 
variable as Crust, and use the terminology Mid (for MidCrust and ClassicCrust) and Thin (for ThinNCrispy and ThinCrust).


* Similarly, the variable Topping uses company-specific terminology.  We recommend using Supreme to refer to the Supreme (Domino's) 
and Super Supremo (Eagle Boys) pizzas.


Observation 192 and 193 are missing completely, for unknown reasons.


STORY BEHIND THE DATA:
The data come from a well-publicised advertising campaign in Australia, where one company (Eagle Boys Pizzas) claim their pizzas are bigger 
than those from another company (Domino's). A number of clams are made on the advertising campaign webpage, and these claims are assessed 
using data made publicly available by Eagle Boys.  The two most obvious claims are (i) Eagle Boys large pizzas are bigger than Domino's 
large pizzas; and (ii) Eagle Boys large pizzas are 12 inches in diameter.



MOZNOSTI ANALYZY:

Hlavni zajmova promenna je velikost pizzy.

Deskriptivni statistika – numericka (prumery, smerodatne odchylky, pocet dat v kategorii apod.), graficka (krabicove diagramy), kde vhodno zvlast pro ruzne skupiny, napr. podle dvou spolecnosti, podle druhu pizzy u jednotlivych spolecnosti apod.


Testy hypotez: porovnani prumeru pizzy mezi dvemi spolecnostmi (pro jednotlive tytpy pizzy?), test hypotezy, ze prumer pizzy spolecnosti Eagle Boys je 12 palcu, apod.

Analyza rozptylu: Porovnejte prumery jednotlivych druhu pizzy pro kazdou spolecnost zvlast

Pripadne pouzijte neparametricke verze testu.
